The objective of this project is to develop a distributed file-sharing application designed for Local Area Networks (LAN). The software facilitates seamless file transfers and real-time media streaming by utilizing a hybrid connectivity approach. By integrating Wi-Fi hotspot technology, Bluetooth protocols, and standard internet access, the system ensures robust peer-to-peer data exchange across various environments.
